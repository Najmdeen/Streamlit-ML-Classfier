# Streamlit Classifier Explorer

## Introduction
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed for exploring and comparing different machine learning classifiers. It uses popular Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and sklearn to handle data processing and model training.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, the app offers an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with.
- **Classifier Comparison**: Users can explore different classifiers like RandomForest, LogisticRegression, KNeighbors, and SVC.
- **Model Metrics**: The application provides accuracy scores and other metrics to evaluate each classifier's performance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to install the required libraries. Use the following command:

```shell
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```
## Usage
To start the Streamlit application, navigate to the project directory and execute:
